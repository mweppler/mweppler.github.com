<h2 class="entry-title">Self Extracting Jar Application</h2>
<div class="entry-content">
  <p>About a year ago, a client of mine needed to send sensitive files over the internet. They wanted something simple enough that the recipient wouldn’t need any special software installed to access the files. I started working on a java app that would be contained in an executable jar file. It worked as expected and they were happy. I’ve fixed it up a little more and decided to make the application along with the source available.</p>
<p>Details of the app are:</p>
<p>The sender simply double clicks on the jar file (SelfExtractingJar.jar), supplies an Encryption key or Password, and selects a file from the file system. Deliver the newly created *.jar file and the encryption key anyway they like. The recipient double clicks on the encrypted .jar file, supplies the encryption key and a directory to decrypt/extract. The application cleans up after itself and close.</p>
<p>Below are links the the application itself and the public github repo.</p>
<p>You can grab the app (SelfExtractingJar.jar):<br>
