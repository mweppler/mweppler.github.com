  <p>About a year ago, a client of mine needed to send sensitive files over the internet. They wanted something simple enough that the recipient wouldn’t need any special software installed to access the files. I started working on a java app that would be contained in an executable jar file. It worked as expected and they were happy. I’ve fixed it up a little more and decided to make the application along with the source available.</p>
  <p>Details of the app are:</p>
  <p>The sender simply double clicks on the jar file (SelfExtractingJar.jar), supplies an Encryption key or Password, and selects a file from the file system. Deliver the newly created *.jar file and the encryption key anyway they like. The recipient double clicks on the encrypted .jar file, supplies the encryption key and a directory to decrypt/extract. The application cleans up after itself and close.</p>
  <p>Below are links the the application itself and the public github repo.</p>
  <p>You can grab the app <a href="http://goo.gl/qjy4m" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','goo.gl']);">SelfExtractingJar.jar</a> from dropbox.</p>
  <p>If youre a developer and would like to checkout/contribute to the project its hosted on <a href="http://goo.gl/8edPo" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','goo.gl']);">GitHub</a></p>
