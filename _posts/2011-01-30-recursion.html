<h1 class="entry-title">Recursion…</h1>
<div class="entry-content">
						<p>I am growing more and more interested in Algorithms, and with algorithms comes Recursion or so im finding. I found source for Factorial.java and broke it down visually. Hope this helps anyone working with recursion for the first time.</p>
<p><code><br>
public static long factorial(long N) {<br>
   if (N == 1) return 1;<br>
   return N * factorial(N-1);<br>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>So whats happening here:</p>
<p>Lets say your main method looks something like this:</p>
<p><code><br>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
   long factors = 5;<br>
   factorial(factors);<br>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>5 is tested and is not equal to 1 so it moves to N * factorial(N-1)<br>
- 4 is tested and is not equal to 1 so it moves to N * factorial(N-1)<br>
– 3 is tested and is not equal to 1 so it moves to N * factorial(N-1)<br>
— 2 is tested and is not equal to 1 so it moves to N * factorial(N-1)<br>
—- 1 is tested and is equal to 1 so it returns 1<br>
— (N==2) N * (factorial(N-1) returned 1) 1 = 2 and returns 2<br>
– (N==3) N * (factorial(N-1) returned 2) 2 = 6 and returns 6<br>
- (N==4) N * (factorial(N-1) returned 6) 6 = 24 and returns 24<br>
(N==5) N * (factorial(N-1) returned 24) 24 = 120 and returns 120</p>
<p>So 5*4*3*2*1 = 120</p>
<p>Make sense? I hope. If not feel free to comment and ill try to clear it up.</p>
