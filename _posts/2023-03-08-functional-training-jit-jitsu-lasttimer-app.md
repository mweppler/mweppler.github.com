# Functional Training and how it can improve your Jiu Jitsu

Functional training is a type of exercise that focuses on movements that mimic daily activities, sports-specific skills, and overall functional movements. When combined with a LastTimer app, functional training can be an effective way to improve your Jiu Jitsu skills and overall fitness. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of a functional training program using the LastTimer app and how it can improve your Jiu Jitsu performance.

## Improved Balance and Coordination

Jiu Jitsu requires excellent balance and coordination skills to execute techniques correctly. Functional training exercises like single-leg deadlifts, pistol squats, and Bosu ball exercises can help improve your balance and coordination. By using the LastTimer app, you can track your progress and gradually increase the difficulty level of these exercises, leading to better balance and coordination skills over time.

## Increased Flexibility

Flexibility is essential for Jiu Jitsu as it allows for greater range of motion and reduces the risk of injury. Functional training exercises like yoga, foam rolling, and dynamic stretching can improve your flexibility. With the LastTimer app, you can set specific time intervals for each exercise, ensuring you get the most out of your stretching routine.

## Improved Strength and Power

Jiu Jitsu requires both strength and power to execute techniques effectively. Functional training exercises like squats, lunges, and kettlebell swings can help increase your strength and power. By using the LastTimer app, you can set specific time intervals for each exercise and track your progress over time, leading to increased strength and power.

## Better Endurance

Endurance is crucial for Jiu Jitsu, as matches can last for several minutes. Functional training exercises like rowing, running, and cycling can help improve your endurance. The LastTimer app can help you track your progress and gradually increase the duration and intensity of these exercises, leading to better endurance over time.

## Reduced Risk of Injury

Jiu Jitsu can be a physically demanding sport, and the risk of injury is high. Functional training exercises like stability ball exercises, balance drills, and plyometrics can help improve your core stability, balance, and overall athleticism, reducing the risk of injury. The LastTimer app can help you set specific time intervals for each exercise, ensuring you get the most out of your training routine while minimizing the risk of injury.

A functional training program using the LastTimer app can be highly beneficial for improving Jiu Jitsu skills and overall fitness. Functional training focuses on movements that mimic daily activities and sports-specific skills. By using the LastTimer app, individuals can track their progress and gradually increase the difficulty level of exercises, leading to improvements in balance, coordination, flexibility, strength, power, endurance, and a reduced risk of injury.
