<h2 class="entry-title">Why do you want to create your own programming language?</h2>

  So before I get into "Why I want to write my own programming language", a little bit of back story. Bottom line, my blog has become stagnant. I've wanted to share my thoughts on being a developer, writing web applications, software, etc... but who has the time? I mean between my day job as a web developer for <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a>, a new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVk0Gm2Mes8&feature=share&list=UUS1VsyCEa1XwwB7_0MuyfEQ" target="_blank">father</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/brokerage-management-systems" target="_blank">Brokerage Management Systems</a>, keep up with my blog? Really? Yes actually, that is something I want to do. So the desire is there but what is the next road block? Well, writing! I don't mind a short email, or txt message, but an entire blog post?

    ...and then there was Paul Irishs' video <a href="http://youtu.be/y3I9guuJJ_Q" target="_blank">A walk with Paul Irish</a>. If you are a web developer, or toying with the idea of becoming a web developer, you should certainly check his video out. Not only is it a great video on web development, but inspired me to:
    <ul>
      <li>get out of the apt, and take a walk...</li>
      <li>update my blog with a short video on what I am up to these days...</li>
    </ul>

    I love talking to my wife about the Joys &amp; Pains as a developer. Not cause she gets it but because she doesn't, yet I manage to "mezmerize her" (her words mind you). We were taking a walk this weekend and I figured I'd record a conversation we had regarding a book I am reading. I held my iPhone up and hit record. The camera was running and I was speechless... I stopped recording, and tried again. I hit record, mumbled a word or two, and stopped recording again. It just didn't feel natural. So I turned to my wife and said "when I say now, ask me about this book that I am reading"
  </p>
  <p>
    A few seconds later I said "ok, now" &amp; hit record...
